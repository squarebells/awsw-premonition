# Premonition
I really liked how Naomi's and PC's relationship started developing in the two last scenes of A Solitary Mind's (ASM) ending A, so I decided to write an expansion. This mod's extra interactions are mostly based on remembering things from other timelines. I decided to use this trope because it was the most interesting thing in the base game for me.

You need to have acquired ASM's ending A to unlock this mod, because it takes place in a timeline after that. To get the the new scenes, start from the very beginning, select the new options whenever possible and of course be as nice as possible to Naomi. I'm not sure if I have yet patched all the holes that can be caused by skipping, so avoid doing that.

Contains lewd scenes. In case you don't like that kind of stuff, the NSFW toggle that comes with the modtools works well. Also, this mod assumes the PC is male, at least for now.

 + Magmalink by Jakzie2. [GitHub](https://gitlab.com/jakzie2/awsw-magmalink) [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2594080243)

 I recommend using "manual" versions from GitHub whenever possible, because having too many steam mod subscriptions causes an annoying startup-crashing race condition bug. Also, the steam workshop versions there might be older, so if you want to be absolutely sure everything works, use GitHub versions.
 
 ### Optional Requirement:
 + BangOk by 4onen (very NSFW). [GitHub](https://github.com/4onenm/AwSW-Bangok)
 
### Recommended:
 + Side Images by 4onen. [GitHub](https://github.com/4onen/AwSW-Side-Images) [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2521431664)
 + Savior by EvilChaosKnight (eventually)
