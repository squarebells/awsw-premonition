# Premonition
I really liked how Naomi's and PC's relationship started developing in the two last scenes of A Solitary Mind's (ASM) ending A, so I decided to write an expansion. This mod's content is mostly based on acting differently due to interference from other timelines. I decided to use this trope because it was the most interesting thing in the base game for me. There's also some stuff I was thinking about while playing the base game and other mods.

You need to have acquired ASM's ending A to unlock this mod, because it takes place in a timeline after that. To get the the new scenes, start from the very beginning, select the new options whenever possible and of course be as nice as possible to Naomi. I'm not sure yet if I have patched all the holes that can be caused by skipping, so avoid doing that.

Contains lewd scenes. In case you don't like that kind of stuff, the NSFW toggle that comes with the modtools works well. Also, this mod assumes the PC is male, at least for now.
 
### Requirements:
 + A Solitary Mind (ASM) by EvilChaosKnight. To be updated to use Magmalink by Jakzie2. [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1597292073)

 I recommend using "manual" versions from GitHub whenever possible, because having too many steam mod subscriptions causes an annoying startup-crashing race condition bug. Also, the steam workshop versions might be older, so if you want to be absolutely sure everything works, use the provided GitHub versions. Lastly, this mod was developed with the Magmalink versions of ASM and ECK Core. There probably aren't any bugs due to this, but I can't say for sure.
 
 To install mods from GitHub, the folder extracted from the downloaded archive goes to `~\Angels with Scaly Wings\game\mods`.
 
### Optional Requirement:
 + BangOk by 4onen (all references not yet done though, also very NSFW). [GitHub](https://github.com/4onenm/AwSW-Bangok)

+ `cg\*.jpg`: Ending and credits screens modified and created squarebells in the same style than in ASM.
+ `cr\naomi_*.png`: Put together from ECK Core's assets by squarebells.
+ `fx\lewd\`: Sounds edited by squarebells, originally extracted from COM3D2.
+ `fx\*.ogg`: Edited from base game sound assets by squarebells.

### About giving feedback:

+ You can find me on the AwSW Fan Discord -server. The place to give me feedback and bug reports is by private message or in the mod thread.
+ Remember to always download the latest version before playing the mod, if your intention is to give feedback. At first, I will probably push small fixes every couple of days.
+ If your feedback is longer than a paragraph, formatting all it beforehand is good for easier readability. It's also useful because you can send me everything in a single go and won't have to constantly bombard me with messages, which can get annoying.
