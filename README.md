# Premonition
I really liked how Naomi's and PC's relationship started developing in the two last scenes of A Solitary Mind's (ASM) ending A. As I was left wanting for more, I wrote an expansion.

You need to have acquired ASM ending A to unlock this, because this mod takes place in a timeline after that. After this expansion to the five base chapters has been finished, I will write a chapter six.

To get the this mod's scenes, select the new options whenever possible and of course be as nice as possible to mod Naomi. Also, contains lewd scenes. This mod assumes the PC is male, for now.
