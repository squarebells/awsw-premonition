# Premonition
I really liked how Naomi's and PC's relationship started developing in the two last scenes of A Solitary Mind's (ASM) ending A. As I was left wanting for more, I wrote an expansion. Most of the content is in date two, because I had to come up with a plausible reason for why Naomi would want to get intimate with the PC that early.

You need to have acquired ASM's ending A to unlock this mod, because it takes place in a timeline after that. To get the the new scenes, start from the very beginning, select the new options whenever possible and of course be as nice as possible to mod Naomi. Don't skip, since only dates two and three have proper skips as of right now.

Also, in case you didn't already realize, this mod contains lewd scenes. The mod assumes the PC is male, for now.


 
### Requirements:
 + [Modtools](https://github.com/4onen/AWSW-Modtools) by 4onen
 + [Magmalink](https://gitlab.com/jakzie2/awsw-magmalink) by Jakzie2

 + [Community Resource and Assets Pack](https://gitlab.com/jakzie2/awsw-crap) by Jakzie2, Eval, 4onen, Azrynfolf and Ryann
 
 I recommend using "manual" versions from GitHub whenever possible, because having too many steam mod subscriptions causes an annoying startup-crashing race condition bug.
 
 ### Optional Requirement:

### Recommended:
