# Premonition
I really liked how Naomi's and PC's relationship started developing in the two last scenes of A Solitary Mind's (ASM) ending A, so I decided to write an expansion. This mod's extra interactions are mostly based on remembering things from other timelines. I decided to use this trope because it was the most interesting thing in the base game for me.

You need to have acquired ASM's ending A to unlock this mod, because it takes place in a timeline after that. To get the the new scenes, start from the very beginning, select the new options whenever possible and of course be as nice as possible to Naomi. I'm not sure if I have yet patched all the holes that can be caused by skipping, so avoid doing that.

Contains lewd scenes. In case you don't like that kind of stuff, the NSFW toggle that comes with the modtools works well. Also, this mod assumes the PC is male, at least for now.

 I recommend using "manual" versions from GitHub whenever possible, because having too many steam mod subscriptions causes an annoying startup-crashing race condition bug. Also, the steam workshop versions might be older, so if you want to be absolutely sure everything works, use the provided GitHub versions.
 
 To install mods from GitHub, the folder extracted from the downloaded archive goes to `~\Angels with Scaly Wings\game\mods`.
 
 ### Optional Requirement:
 + BangOk by 4onen (very NSFW). [GitHub](https://github.com/4onenm/AwSW-Bangok)

### About giving feedback:

+ The place to give me feedback and bug reports is on Discord. You can find me on the AwSW Fan Discord -server.
+ Remember to always download the latest version before playing the mod, if your intention is to give feedback. At first, I will probably push small fixes at least every other day.
+ Properly formatting all your feedback beforehand is good for easier readability. It's also good because you can send me everything in a single go and won't have to constantly bombard me with messages, which can get annoying.
