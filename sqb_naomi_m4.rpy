    c "There's no lockers or containers for my clothes though. I guess I'll just have to drop them on the floor."
    Nm blank "Is that a problem?"
    c "They might get wet and dirty. Wet clothes aren't very nice to wear, especially if it's cold. We have to leave this place at some point, you know."
    Nm normal "Just put them in the corner over there. It's far enough from the pool. I promise I'll avoid splashing any water over there."
    c "I guess that will work."
    Nm smile "I also got you another wetsuit just in case, but could I suggest that you'll put us on equal footing by swimming naked as well?" 
    Nm "Those windows are also almost completely opaque to anyone trying to look in from the outside, so you won't have to worry about any dragons using binoculars to try to look at your private parts."
    c "Sure, that works for me since you've seen and felt every part of my body already. You're right that I would be a little hesitant to go naked if anyone could see us here."
    Nm normal "We don't need this then."
    m "Naomi pulled out a small plastic package from her belt bag, which presumably had the wetsuit, and placed it on the floor."
    c "No, it's actually very useful. I can put my clothing in that plastic bag, so they won't go wet."
    Nm smile "I guess I am prepared for everything."

    m "I took all my clothes off and stuffed them in the plastic bag with the wetsuit. Meanwhile, Naomi had dropped her bag on the floor and happily jumped into the water. I expected a huge splash, but her entry was surprisingly smooth."
