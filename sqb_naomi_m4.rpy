    Nm normal "Just put them on the lounge chair over there, it's far enough from the pool. I promise I'll avoid splashing any water over there."
    c "I guess that will work."
    Nm smile "I also got you another wetsuit just in case, but could I suggest that you'll put us on equal footing by swimming naked as well?" 
    Nm "Those windows are also almost completely opaque to anyone trying to look in from the outside, so you won't have to worry about any dragons using binoculars to try to look at your private parts."
    c "Sure, that works for me. You're right that I would be a little hesitant to be here naked if anyone could see me from the outside."
    Nm normal "We don't need this then."
    m "Naomi pulled out a small plastic package from her belt bag, which presumably had the wetsuit, and placed it on the floor."
    c "No, it's actually very useful. I can put my clothing in that plastic bag, so they won't get wet."

    c "Yeah. A moment to take a breather for us both."
    Nm blank "Should've brought us some drinks, but I'm a little wary of alcohol."
    c "Yeah, I noticed. I like a bit of alcohol every now and then, and you could even say I consume it regularly. Still, drinking almost every day like Bryce does, is very bad for you both physically and mentally."
    Nm normal "I agree. He drinks way too much for his own good, and in a way, I'm rather afraid of ending up like him." #Skipping condition since Bryce can't be dead in this timeline
    c "Based on your personality, I doubt you would end up like him. Also, you have me to help keep you on the right track."

    c "Now, I'm not saying this because I want you to drink more alcohol, I just think that you evidently have more self-control than he does. I could never work as late as you do or regularly skip my lunch breaks."

    c "Those things are obviously not good things to do, but they're still things that everyone doesn't have the willpower for."
    Nm smile "I understand your point. From your perspective, that's a strange yet nice compliment."
    Nm normal "Anyway, a part of me wants to tell Bryce to look after himself better and cut down on alcohol, but I can't bring myself to invade his personal life with unsolicited advice."
    c "Nothing is stopping you from doing so. You are friends, and it's natural that you would be concerned about his well-being. Just remember that if you bring it up too often your good intentions might backfire and cause him to drink even more."
    Nm smile "That's a good point."
    Nm shy "Still, I'm hesitant because he hasn't really changed, despite all the time he has spent spent in the local bar. And... and maybe, it's just not my business after all. He does what he does to cope with the stress."
    c "Still, I think you could try and speak up. In fact, we could mention it to him together next time we see him."
    Nm normal "I'll think about it."
    Nm "But for now, it's just you and me here, so I would rather focus on the pleasant stuff."
    c "Sounds like a fine idea."
    Nm smile "I'm glad we share this sentiment."    
    c "Though, I'm surprised you haven't invited anyone else to join us."
    Nm shy "I... I thought about it. But this meeting is sort of an apology to you for what happened during our last date."
    Nm "And since I honestly don't know how well you get along with the others, I decided against taking any risks of ruining this one."
    c "Hey, it's all good. We've also had some really fun times with just the two of us, right? Besides, this pool is certainly too small for more than two people."
    Nm smile "Yeah. We've already done so much together. I can't wait to find out what the future holds."
