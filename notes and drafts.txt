Plan (outdated sketch): 

1. Finish a number of hooked scenes
2. Start adding references to BangOk.
3. Add optional or failure paths for the illusion of choice. (Or move straight to chapter 6? That's where the interesting stuff is)
4. Sex scene alterations
5. Finish chapter 6
6. Separate sex into a second mod? BangOk?

General themes and ideas (also outdated): 

1. How does having premonitions from subconsciously remembering alternate realities feel like from the pc's perspective? In the base game this was explored mostly on the meta-game level (in the player's ,NOT the PC's!, head)
2. Personal happiness versus your duty to others. Do you have to keep going when the bad circumstances weren't your fault? To what lengths does your duty to others go?
3. Discussion about what is real
4. Talking about what if it's a time loop after all? Discussing the repercussions of that on their lives? Maybe put this in the post ending scenes?

(Small?) Differences of the new Naomi compared to the original:

1. Naomi is more protective of the PC
2. More open about liking humans (inter species relationships)
3. Likes the PC more, doesn't at first know why
4. More practical? (maybe the PC just went beyond her abstraction capabilities?)

Notes on Naomi:

1. Is afraid of being used: wants to be in control but still much nicer than Anna (loads of references, her past relationships)
2. Likes teasing their partner, but not in a very serious way (i guess)
3. Likes smaller partners and different species. Intrigued by the idea of being complemented and cooperating?
4. Likes cuddling and it's not necessarily sexual in nature (Naomi's computer after-scene from Savior and ending A scene before the secret one)
5. Protective of their partner
6. Likes to be fed cooked for and fed food because its inconvenient for her

Differences in the PC

1. Talks more openly about himself and how shit his city state is
2. More direct in his advances (caused subconsciously by different timelines)
3. Even better at cooking than ASM's PC
4. Feels sad more

Possible difficulties:

1. Naomi doesn't sound genuine
2. The philosophy is too information dumpy or hard to understand
3. Cringe dialogue? It might be hard to evaluate myself
4. Too much obvious self-insert
5. Finding and using correct sounds

Solutions:

1.Iterate by replaying over and over again
2.Beta testing and feedback at a later stage

Chapter 1 ideas:

1.  (Done)  PC's views on money

3.          PC finally agrees explicitly to stay in dragonworld forever
4.          Make it so that even if you "fail" at date 2, you can still have sex here?

Chapter 5 ideas:

1.          Have detaining Reza go more easily?
